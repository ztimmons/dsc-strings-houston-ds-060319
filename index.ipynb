    "## Introduction\n",
    "As we already know from living in the digital age and the lessons we've already seen, programming is a powerful tool for answering questions about data. It allows us to collect, clean up and format our data and then perform calculations on that data.\n",
    "Much of our digital information is in the form of text, for example song lyrics and emails. To clean up and format that text with Python, we need to become familiar with our first type of data, the String.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "* Understand and use the **String** data type\n",
    "* Understand, explain and use the correct data types for various types of information\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Strings?\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of information in the world is in the form of text. To capture this information and operate on it in Python we take this text and make it into the **String** (`str`) data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we have the name of a cartoon character, Homer Simpson. By putting quotes (`\"\"`) or (`''`) around the name, we create a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"Homer Simpson\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "When programmers say *string*, what they mean is text.  When programmers say *data type*, they just mean type of data.  We can think of `'Homer Simpson'` as an instance of the string data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few other types of data in Python that we will talk more about in later lessons:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "100 # Integer\n",
    "10.0 # Float\n",
    "True # Boolean\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are several types of data in Python we can discover the type of any piece of data by calling, or executing, the `type()` function. By calling or executing a function, we mean running the function so that it executes the code within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example below:\n",
    "\n",

    "In this lesson, we learned about our first datatype in Python: the string.  A string is just text. We indicate to Python that we are writing a string by surrounding our content with quotation marks. Once we do this, we can operate on this string by calling methods like `upper` or `endswith`. We identified a general pattern for calling methods on datatypes: 'instance of a datatype-dot-method name-parentheses'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing we learned was different mechanisms for learning about methods.  We saw the importance of guessing and experimentation, and how doing so can give us error messages, which provide clues. We also saw how to ask questions about a datatype by calling 'help' followed by the datatype name like `help(str)`.  Finally, we saw we can ask Google.  This mechanism of exploration is a skill we'll build up over time and this course will provide guidance and practice on along the way."
